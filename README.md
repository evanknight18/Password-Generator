## Motivation
The primary motivation for building this project was to gain a deeper understanding of how user input is handled in JavaScript. By focusing on user interaction, I aimed to explore a straightforward and practical application of JavaScript that provides immediate utility for the user.

## Features
- Generate secure passwords instantly.
- Customize password length and complexity.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Real-time display of generated password based on input criteria.

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/evanknight18/secure-password-generator.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
