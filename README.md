# <Password-Generator>

My motivation for this project was to really understand how user input is handled with javascript.

I built this project because it is a great straight forward way of using javascript for user interaction.

This project makes it simple for the user to come up with a secure password in seconds.
 
I learned a great deal of the order the code should follow as well as how the code stores user input to use in a final result. I also further learned how to analyze 
individual blocks of code and how they work together in order.
